              Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, and <br>
              sometimes we are unsure about how to get the right word. To <br> crack
              the code for the UX copies, we at Zeta Design wanted to build <br> a
              Figma plugin for the larger design community. The plugin <br> is called
              the Ghost UXWriter and has a set of UX copies cataloged <br> and
              categorized with a voice and tone variation ranging from  plain<br> ,
              casual to playful. The intention to build this Figma plugin <br>
              originated from our Medium blog post, â€˜Designing voice and tone <br>
              for error messages.
